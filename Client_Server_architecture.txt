Client Server model is an architecture design where you separate the client and server.
It can 2 tier or 3 tier.Usually it is 3 tier.
2 tier means client directly interacts with db server.
3 tier means client interacts with app server which interacts with db.
Thus 3 tier helps to keep UI,business logic and data separate,thus making it scalable.

It can be stateful or stateless.Stateful means the client session data is stored on server.Thus scaling it mighr be difficult and
if wanting to scale must have a common session storage.stateless does not store any session data of user.

Stateful Communication - Web sockets ,WhatsApp,Realtime Gaming and E commerce cart 

Stateless comm - Github login,Login authentication api call
